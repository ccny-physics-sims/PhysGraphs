TODO list for physgraphs
& general developer notes.

+graph
	>> margin auto resize to fit labels and titles (also based
		on length of y and x values)
	>> add touch interactivity [IMPORTANT!!]
	>> make x and y resolutions independent (y=-1 is default
		that way for default the x res val will be for 
		both axis). 
+plot
	>> different line styles
	>> optimizing
		>> optimizeX and optY for doing as follows:
			for optx when three points in a row have the
			same y coords, remove the middle point. (should
			help a lot for timeplots where motion is linear				) 
	>> 
+legend
	>> title
	>> color for each line
	>> linestyles when they are included in plots 
	>>
